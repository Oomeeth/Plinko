# Plinko App Submission

## This is my submission for the Plinko Assessment.

## There are user defined variables at the top of `index.html`. Please check comments in `index.html`.

## I have used PixiJS and JavaScript in this project.

## Here is a list of features I have worked on according to the assessment guidelines:
- [x] Use vanilla JS/TS with HTML5 Canvas or PixiJS.
- [x] Game board with pegs arranged in a grid pattern and slots at the bottom.
- [x] Develop a set of calculations to animate the movement of your ball/puck through the board along different paths.
- [ ] Move the puck left or right above a peg, then moving it down to the next peg and choosing left or right again...
- [x] Implement a class/method for animations.
- [x] The player starts with 100 points.
- [x] Each puck drop costs 10 points.
- [x] Each basket has a specific value: 10, 5, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 10. If the puck lands in a basket, its value is added to the player's points.
- [x] The scoring system tracks the player's score throughout the game.
- [x] Path Calculation.
- [x] Higher-value slots less likely to be chosen.
- [ ] Visual polish.

## Additional Features:
